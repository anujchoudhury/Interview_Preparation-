int * p = new int(1000); 
This works!

experimenting, I found that 
int c, *pc=NULL;
c=5;
*pc=c;
doesnt work, but if i DONT initialize it to NULL, it works. Why ? - simple enough - garbage value initialization
void *ptr; // pointer to void
 
pass by reference without pointers - swap(int &a, int &b) - while calling the function, arguments are ostensibly the integers, though really, their references are passed, wothout pointers being explicitly involved 
pass by reference with pointers - swap(int* a, int* b) - here, while calling the function, the addresses have to be involved, and the addresses are passed to the function
